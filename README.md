# A big step... 🚀
Welcome to my agenda project!📔 This project has been an exciting journey, introducing me to various aspects of web development. 🌐

## Overview
This project encompasses a range of technologies and concepts, including:

- **Back-end Development:** Utilized Node.js to build the server-side logic, enabling dynamic content generation.
